Fluent Routing API for ASP.NET MVC
==================================

This package provides a fluent programming interface to make routing easier in ASP.NET MVC projects.

Fluent Routing is in early beta testing.  It might not work at all.  There is no documentation yet,
other than XML documentation comments, which can be seen in Visual Studio's IntelliSense.

If you run into trouble, send a tweet to @sharpjs.
